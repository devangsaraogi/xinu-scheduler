Q1
A. EXPDISTSCHED
Advantages:
1) ensures probabilistc fairness while still favoring high priority processes
2) reduces startvation compared to strict priority scheduling
3) handles bursty workloads well because it uses the exponential distribution to decide which process to pick next

Disadvantages:
1) scheduling is non-deterministic
2) randomness could result in short term unfairness
3) no guarentee scheduling because low priority process can preempt a high priority one

B. LINUXSCHED
Advantages:
1) good balance of fairness and responsiveness by computing goodness factor
2) avoids startvation because of epoch reset mechanism; all processes get CPU time
3) designed in a way that cpu bound processes get smaller quanta in future epochs and interractive tasks get larger quanta in future epochs

Disadvantages:
1) complex; have to track epochs and goodness
2) slight increase in switch overhead because of epoch, goodness recomputation
3) difficult to predict behavior compared to fixed priority or round robin scheduling

C. DEFAULT XINU: ROUND ROBIN
Advantages:
1) simple and deterministic - all ready processes share cpu equally in order
2) low overhead - no priority calculation
3) suitable for systems with tasks which are going to run processes of equal weight

Disadvantages:
1) no adaptability - high priority processes cannot preempt low priority processes
2) can lead to inefficient use of cpu if many short or i/o processes exist

Q2
A. EXPDISTSCHED
- the scheduler samples a random key from the exponential distribution and scans the ready queue for a matching process
- if the queue is empty, null process is run

B. LINUXSCHED
- during an epoch, the scheduler picks the process with the highest goodness value
- if/when all processes have goodness value = 0, a new epoch is started and if no process becomes ready after that, the scheduler runs the null process
- the null process will only run when other process are blocked/sleeping or they have exhausted quanta

C. DEFAULT XINU: ROUND ROBIN
- the scheduler maintains a ready queue of processes i.e. all process are PRREADY
- every reschedule, process with high priority is picked and if the queue is empty chooses the null process
